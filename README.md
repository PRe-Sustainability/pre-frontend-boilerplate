# Frontend Assignment

This repository serves as a boilerplate for a frontend assignment using the following technologies: React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. It also includes examples showcasing the usage of Redux Toolkit (RTK) Slice and RTK Query API.

The repository contains a simple counter app which you can use as a reference. The assignment concerns the addition of new functionality unrelated to the counter app.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the UI development server by executing the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the UI in your default web browser. You can view and interact with the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Start the API server using the following command:

```bash
yarn api
```

This will start the json-server and provide a RESTful API interface to simulate backend data.

You can replace the URL to the json-server with a link to the actual API in the assignment.

## Technologies Used

The project includes the following technologies and libraries:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit (RTK): A package that simplifies Redux setup and reduces boilerplate code.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Vitest: A JavaScript testing framework (You can change "Vitest" to "Jest" if desired).

## Development and Testing

During development, you can modify the existing code or add new features based on the provided assignment requirements. Feel free to remove the examples showcasing Redux Toolkit if they are not needed for your assignment.

To test the application, you can run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute the test suites using Jest and provide you with the test results.
